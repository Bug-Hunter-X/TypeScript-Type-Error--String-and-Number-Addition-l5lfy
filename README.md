# TypeScript Type Error: String and Number Addition

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript that occurs when attempting to add a string and a number.  TypeScript's type system prevents this operation to maintain type safety.

The `bug.ts` file contains code that attempts this invalid addition. The `bugSolution.ts` file shows how to correctly handle this by ensuring both operands are numbers.
